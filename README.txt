MEncryptor is a free encryption tool with many protocols and a frequency analyzer to break any monoalphabetic system.
The project uses Qt 5 opensource.

Its sources are in the "Sources" folder.
The files to put next to the compiled executable are in "Release Files" folder.

I recently decided to leave Windows for Linux (Ubuntu) and I'm not going to update it for Windows anymore. I will also update to Qt 6.
